/*! Simulates the backscattering of a given signal on point targets.
 *
 * Implements the point scatter model. The input signal is the transmitted
 * signal. The output signal is the received, backscattered signal, and
 * contains one output signal per receive antenna.
 *
 * \section radar_target_modeling Target modeling
 *
 * The targets are modeled by the vectors \p range, \p velocity, \p rcs,
 * and \p azimuth. All these vectors need to be of length H, where H
 * describes the number of reflecting targets. The backscattered signal
 * can either have a zero phase, or a random phase (controlled by
 * \p rndm_phaseshift).  The received signal will be the linear
 * superposition of H signals, each of which are derived from the input
 * signal by the following equation:
 *
 * \f[
 *     r_h(t) = b_h s(t - \tau_h) e^{j2\pi f_{D,h}}
 * \f]
 *
 * The attenuation depends on the center frequency \f$f_C\f$, the radar
 * cross section \f$\sigma_{\text{RCS},h}\f$, the distance of the target
 * \f$d_h\f$ and the speed of light \f$c_0\f$:
 * \f[
 *     b_h = \sqrt{\frac{c_0^2 \sigma_{\text{RCS},h}}{(4\pi)^3 d_h^4 f_C^2}}
 * \f]
 *
 * The delay \f$\tau_h\f$ depends on the distance of the target:
 * \f[
 *     \tau_h = 2\frac{d_h}{c_0}
 * \f]
 *
 * The Doppler shift \f$f_{D,h}\f$ depends on the relative velocity and
 * the center frequency:
 * \f[
 *     f_{D,h} = 2\frac{v_{\text{rel},h}{c_0} f_C
 * \f]
 *
 * The signals are added up to produce the total sum signal:
 * \f[
 *     r(t) = \sum_{h=0}^{H-1} r_h(t)
 * \f]
 *
 * \section radar_mimo_processing MIMO processing simulation
 *
 * This block has a limited capability of simulating multi-antenna
 * reception. The \p position_rx vector determines the distance of every
 * RX antenna from the origin (Note: The TX antenna is always in the
 * origin). The length of the \p position_rx vector is thus also the number
 * of output signals this block produces. For a simple, mono-static SISO
 * radar, simply set position_rx to [0].
 * The RX antennas are always laid out in a straight line. When multiple
 * antennas are given, the target azimuth plays a role; an azimuth of zero
 * is perpendicular to the line in which the RX antennas are placed.
 *
 * \section radar_hw_impairments Self-coupling
 *
 * Self-coupling describes the amount of the TX signal that is directly
 * coupled into the RX path. When \p self_coupling is set to true,
 * effectively, a target with zero velocity and range is added. The
 * parameter \p self_coupling_db describes the attenuation of the
 * self-coupling, a value of -10 means that the transmit signal is
 * attenuated by 10 dB on the receive signal.
