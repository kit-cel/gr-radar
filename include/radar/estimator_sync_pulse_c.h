 * hardware effect from a signal source can be estimated. The calculation of the shift is
 * done by a cross correlation of the input signals. The number of correlations in samples
 * is given with num_xcorr. The output message is the number of delay samples with the
 * identifier (symbol) 'sync_pulse'. This can be displayed with the 'Print Results' block.
