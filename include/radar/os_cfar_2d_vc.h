 * \brief This block estimates peaks of a given matrix. A matrix can be represented as a
 * combination of vectors and tagged streams. Input has to be a matrix with linear scaled
 * values (NOT logarithmic scaled!). Used algorithm is a 2D OS-CFAR algorithm. The
 * algorithm uses around the cell under test (CUT) on each side samp_compare samples to
 * estimate the noise floor. samp_protect is a protected are around the CUT which is not
 * used for acquiring compare samples. Index 0 of a input vector refers to x axis
 * properties and index 1 refers to y axis properties. The relative threshold is defined
 * by the bin of the vector within the sorted samp_compare samples. A standard value is
 * rel_threshold = 0.78. The value of this bin is multiplied by mult_threshold and
 * compared with the CUT. If the magnitude square of the CUT is greater than the threshold
 * the matrix item is accepted. Used identifiers (symbols) for data are 'axis_x', 'axis_y'
 * and 'power'.
