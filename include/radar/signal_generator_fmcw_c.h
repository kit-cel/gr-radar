 * The generated signal consists of three parts, in this order:
 *
 * 1. CW part with constant frequency
 * 2. Up-chirp
 * 3. Down-chirp
 *
 * The up-chirp goes from CW frequency to CW frequency plus sweep frequency
 * and the down-chirp goes in the opposite direction. All of these parts
 * can be disabled by setting the corresponding length to zero.
 *
 * The packet length for subsequent tagged streams is calculated by the sum
 * of the number of samples of the single modulations parts.
