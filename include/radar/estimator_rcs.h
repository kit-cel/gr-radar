 * \brief Basic RCS block for estimating the RCS of a single target. Some hardware specs
 need to be known for calculating RCS values, see parameters for details. The radar
 equation is used to calculate the RCS: RCS = Pr*(4pi)^3*R^4/(Pt*Gt*Gr*lamda^2). The Rx
 power (Pr) and the distance (R) are being estimated, while the other parameters are given
 in the flowgraph. It is possible to average a number of samples by setting the num_mean
 value > 1. The RCS will be 0 until enough samples are collected to calculate the mean
 value (be patient). The Tx power (Pt) needs to be calibrated with external hardware. I
 recommend to calibrate for the wanted power and not to change the parameters in the
 flowgraph on the Tx side after that. The RCS block needs the Rx power, to estimate the
 RCS. For that, the input power of the block needs to be determined analytically and
 altered via the corr_factor and exponent values, to fit the following equation: Pr =
 P_input ^ (exponent) * corr_factor / Pt. In addition, the FFTs need to be normalized for
 correct power calculation.
 *
 * \param num_mean Number of samples taken into account for calculating mean value (1 for
 no mean calculation)
 * \param center_freq Center frequency of radar
 * \param antenna_gain_tx Antenna Gain of the Tx antenna
 * \param antenna_gain_rx Antenna Gain of the Rx antenna
 * \param usrp_gain_rx Rx gain of USRP set in flowgraph
 * \param power_tx Tx power of radar signal. Needs to be measured one time!
 * \param corr_factor Correction factor for the RCS to calibrate system to a known target
 or special signal paths
 * \param exponent Exponent of the input power to calculate Rx power, depends on signal
 path (calculate analytically)
