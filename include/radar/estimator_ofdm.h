 * \brief This block evaluates the peaks given from a OFDM matrix. Input are the bins of
 * the peaks with the identifiers 'axis_x' and 'axis_y'. The parameters of the block
 * axis_x and axis_y are vectors which define the mapping of the axis. If two values are
 * given it is assumed a linear progression in between. If four values are given the
 * middle values are set on half of the axis and it is interpolated linear in between.
 * len_x and len_y gives the length of the axis in number of bins. symbol_x and symbol_y
 * defines the identifier (symbols) for the output data. merge_consecutive toggles merging
 * consecutive peaks. Each peak is compared with peaks in a range of one bin. If there is
 * a peak with a higher power the actual bin is not used for evaluations. If
 * merge_consecutive is true data with identifier 'power' is needed.
