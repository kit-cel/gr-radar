 * \brief This block generates a signal for the synchronization of the USRP Echotimer in
 * baseband. The signal is pulsed with a constant amplitude with various pulse length and
 * wait samples in between. It is structured by alternating wait parts and burst parts and
 * starting with the first wait part. The pulses are full real signals.
 *
 * \param packet_len The packet length has to be longer or equal than the sum of pulse_len
 * and pulse_pause. \param pulse_len The length of the pulses are defined in a vector and
 * given in number of samples. The pulses are generated alternating with the wait samples
 * defined in pulse_pause. \param pulse_pause The wait samples between pulses are defined
 * in a vector. The first segment of the whole signal is the first element in the
 * pulse_pause vector. This element can be zero. \param pulse_amplitude Pulse amplitude of
 * real signal \param len_key Packet length key for tagged stream
