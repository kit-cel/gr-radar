 * \brief This block estimates peaks of a given FFT spectrum as tagged stream. Multi peak
 * detection is implemented with the OS-CFAR algorithm. The algorithm uses around the cell
 * under test (CUT) on each side samp_compare samples to estimate the noise floor. This
 * relative threshold is defined by the bin of the vector within the sorted samp_compare
 * samples. A standard value is rel_threshold = 0.78. The value of this bin is multiplied
 * by mult_threshold and compared with the CUT. samp_protect samples are a protected are
 * which is not used for acquiring compare samples. If consecutive bins are detected as
 * valid peaks it is possible to merge these detections with merge_consecutive = true.
 * Output data are f32vectors with the information of frequency, power and phase. The
 * identifiers (symbols) are 'frequency', 'power' and 'phase'.
