 * \brief This block tracks a singletarget detection with a particle or kalman filter. As
 * input values with identifiers 'range' and 'velocity' are needed and should hold a
 * f32vector with only one element. All input variables tagged with std gives the standard
 * deviation of the parameter. The threshold_track is a value which decides with the
 * likelihood of the data if the new data is accepted as a track. A good starting value is
 * threshold_track = 0.001. threshold_lost is the number of false tracks unitel the track
 * is lost and the tracker begins with a new one. The string filter decides which tracking
 * kernel should be used. 'kalman' or 'particle' are valid. If 'particle' is chosen
 * num_particle gives the number of particles for the particle filter. If 'kalman' is
 * chosen there is no effect on the tracker.
 *
 * \param num_particle Number of particles for particle filter. There is no effect if
 * kalman filter is chosen. \param std_range_meas Standard deviation of the range
 * measurement \param std_velocity_meas Standard deviation of the velocity measurement
 * \param std_accel_sys Standard deviation of the system acceleration
 * \param threshold_track Value to decide if data is valid for the track
 * \param theshold_lost Number of false tracks until the current track is lost
 * \param filter Filter kernel to be used. 'kalman' or 'particle' are valid.
